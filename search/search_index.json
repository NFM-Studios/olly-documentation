Creating a new News Post Simply click on the \"Create a new article\" button at the bottom of the news list page. Doing so will redirect you to new page where you will enter the information about the news post. Title: Simply the title that you want to appear on the front page. We reccomend for styling purposes that you don't let it go on too long. Image: We recommend that you upload an image of any kind (somewhat relevant maybe?) for each and every news post. If you'd like to know the recommended resolution for news posts images, please feel free to contact. If you do not provide a image when creating a news post the system will automatically show either your websites logo, or some random image in place of the news image. Slug: Slug's are required for the news post to be created. Quite simply they are the url that the user will be redirect to. For example. www.example.com/news/my-awesome-slug Slugs must not have any spaces, but can contain _'s and -'s Body: Simply the body of text. And yes. Linebreaks do account when the news post on the front end, so we don't recommend typing one massive paragraph, maybe hit that enter button a few times and space things out with some empty lines? Publish: Simply going to show the day that the news post was published on Status: Simply tells the system whether or not to show the post on the front end.
